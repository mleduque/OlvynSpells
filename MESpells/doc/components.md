# Improve Bless and (if in-game) Curse


Bless and Curse aren't great spells. They have too many drawbacks: they take a whole round to cast, they only last six rounds, and they only give small bonuses/penalties. This component reduces the casting time of Bless and Curse to 1 and/or increases their duration to 1 turn (your choice).


# Make it so that Command takes control of the target for 1 round instead of putting them to sleep


With this component installed, the spell Command dominates the target for 1 round, so you can actually give them the command of your choice.


# Improve Entangle


This component has several options: you may either make it so Entangle only affects enemies in the area of effect when the spell is cast (as in the original Baldur's Gate), remove the saving throw bonus from Entangle (as in Icewind Dale), or both.


# Improve Magical Stone


This component makes Magical Stone deal 3d4 magic damage, or 6d4 against undead. It's like the IWD version except it deals magic damage rather than crushing damage. This component also makes Magical Stone usable by druids.


# Turn Know Alignment into Identify Creature, which reveals info about the target


This component requires EEex. It turns the useless Know Alignment spell into Identify Creature, which gives useful information about the target (e.g. HP, stats, resistances).


# Increase the duration of Negative Plane Protection to 8 hours


Negative Plane Protection's original duration was way too short. This component extends it to 8 hours.


# Improve Cloak of Fear


In BGEE and BG2EE, Cloak of Fear is just a one-shot fear effect, even though the spell is supposed to give the caster an aura of fear. With this component installed, Cloak of Fear actually gives you an aura of fear. Creatures within 5 feet must Save vs. Spell or run away for 1 round. The aura lasts 1 turn.


# 3E-like Flame Strike and Fire Storm


With this component installed, Flame Strike is an AoE spell that deals 1d6 damage per level (max 15d6), with a Save vs. Spell for half. Half the damage is fire and the other half is magic fire. Fire Storm deals 1d6 fire damage per level (max 20d6), with a Save vs. Spell at -4 for half, and only lasts one round.


# Make it so Champion's Strength sets the target's Strength to 25


Champion's Strength is a bit too weak normally. This component makes the spell set the target's Strength to 25. However, the caster is still prevented from casting any more spells for the duration.


# Make it so Nature's Beauty charms enemies rather than blinding or killing them


With this component installed, Nature's Beauty charms all enemies within 15 feet for 12 rounds (Save vs. Spell at -3 negates). Only humanoids and animals are affected, and elves and half-elves have a chance to resist the spell.


# Original BG1-style Monster Summoning and Animal Summoning spells


This component makes it so the Monster Summoning and Animal Summoning spells summon tons of creatures like they did in the original Baldur's Gate; the creatures will ignore the summoning limit.


# Restore original BG1 Animate Dead


This component makes it so Animate Dead summons 1 skeleton per level, and the skeletons ignore the summoning limit. You choose whether the component changes both the priest and wizard versions of Animate Dead or just the wizard version.


# Weaken devas but allow more than one to be summoned at once


Normally, summoned devas in BG2 are almost as powerful as summoned planetars but have the same one-at-a-time restriction. This component lets you summon more than one deva at a time, but weakens them to make it fair.


# Turn Infravision into True Strike


This component turns the useless Infravision spell into True Strike, which grants +20 THAC0 for just 9 seconds.


# Revise Sleep


With this component installed, the spell Sleep has no Hit Dice limit, but it lasts shorter and the targets will wake up when damaged.


# Revise Power Word, Sleep


With this component installed, Power Word, Sleep works regardless of the target's Hit Points (so it's a no-save Sleep effect), but it lasts only 3 rounds and the target will wake up when damaged.


# Improve Shocking Grasp, Chill Touch and Ghoul Touch


Normally these spells require you to hit someone with an attack, and the spell is wasted if you miss. That makes these spells almost useless because mages aren't very good at hitting things. This component makes it so you can simply cast these spells on a creature (as with Vampiric Touch) without having to attack them. It also improves Chill Touch significantly.


# Improve Larloch's Minor Drain and Vampiric Touch


This component improves these two life-draining spells. Larloch's Minor Drain now drains 12 hit points; Vampiric Touch now drains 3 hit points per level, up to 30 at level 10. In addition, casting these spells multiple times will increase the caster's HP even further.


# Allow familiars to deliver the wizard's touch spells


This component requires EEex. With it installed, if the PC casts a touch spell on a distant enemy and the familiar is next to that enemy, the familiar will cast the touch spell on the enemy (at the PC's caster level).


# Improve low-level spells that detect illusions


This component improves Detect Invisibility, Detect Illusions, and Invisibility Purge. Detect Invisibility is now a buff that gives the target creature the ability to see invisible creatures for the duration (this requires EEex; if you don't have EEex installed then Detect Invisibility won't be modified). Detect Illusions is now Dispel Illusions, which dispels all illusions on enemies (like True Sight except it only triggers once). Invisibility Purge now also prevents enemies from going invisible again for several rounds.


# Improve spells that merely weaken enemies rather than disable them


This component greatly improves three spells: Ray of Enfeeblement, Deafness, and Contagion. Their saving throws are made with large penalties, and if the caster is higher level than the target, these spells will offer no save.


# Have Skull Trap cap at 10d6 damage


It makes no sense for Skull Trap to deal up to 20d6 damage. This means it deals more damage than Delayed Blast Fireball despite being four levels lower. This component makes Skull Trap cap at 10d6 damage from a 10th-level caster like other AoE 3rd-level spells.


# Improve Ice Storm


In both Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale, Ice Storm could use some improvement. In Baldur's Gate, Ice Storm only lasts 3 rounds when it should last 4 rounds. In Icewind Dale, Ice Storm deals less damage than Fireball despite being a level higher. This component has two options, which can be installed in either game:
<ul><li>BG2-style improved Ice Storm: 2d10 damage per round for 4 rounds</li>
<li>IWD-style improved Ice Storm: 6d10 damage all at once</li>
</ul>

# Prevent Stoneskin from making characters grey


This component requires EEex. With it installed, Stoneskin effects won't give the character a grey color. This component involves patching creature AI, so if you're using SCS, install SCS first, then install this.


# Restore original BG1 Otiluke's Resilient Sphere (no saving throw)


To make Otiluke's Resilient Sphere more useful, this component restores it to how it was in the original Baldur's Gate, where it offered no save.


# Restore original BG1 Cone of Cold


The Cone of Cold spell in the pre-enhanced version of Baldur's Gate was quite unusual (though you never got to see it because the original Baldur's Gate didn't have any Cone of Cold scrolls). It had longer range the higher level the caster, and the cone was bigger the farther away the target point. This component restores Cone of Cold to how it was in the original Baldur's Gate, with these features.


# Make it so the spell Oracle lets you foresee what spells enemies are going to cast (like Spellcraft in 3rd-edition games)


This component requires EEex. With this component installed, Oracle doesn't detect illusions. Instead, it detects the spells enemies are casting. For the duration, whenever and enemy starts casting a spell, you learn what spell they're casting.


# Make it so Mislead's invisibility becomes partial invisibility when you attack or cast a spell, just like Improved Invisibility (regardless of whether the image is still alive)


Normally Mislead keeps you completely invisible even after you attack if the image is still alive. This is very overpowered, especially when combined with backstabbing. With this component installed, Mislead is just like Improved Invisibility except with an extra image spawned.


# Make it so Protection from Magical Weapons only lasts 3 rounds but Absolute Immunity lasts 5 rounds


Protection from Magical Weapons is better than or as good as Mantle, Improved Mantle and Absolute Immunity despite being a lower-level spell. This component weakens Protection from Magical Weapons but improves Absolute Immunity. This way, you might want to use Mantle, Improved Mantle or Absolute Immunity sometimes, and not just Protection from Magical Weapons all the time.


# Improve Chain Lightning


Chain Lightning deals too little damage normally. This component changes Chain Lightning to be more like its Icewind Dale version (it bounces between creatures, dealing 1d6 less damage with each bounce), except it deals up to 20d6 damage and doesn't harm allies.


# Improve Delayed Blast Fireball


This component gives Delayed Blast Fireball some level scaling: it deals 1d6 per level, up to 20d6.


# Make Meteor Swarm bombard the area randomly with small meteors rather than a single area of effect


Normally Meteor Swarm is flat-out worse than Incendiary Cloud (at level 18, Meteor Swarm deals 4d10 damage (22 on average) per round while Incendiary Cloud deals 9d4 damage (22.5 on average) even on a successful save). This component doesn't significantly improve Meteor Swarm, but it makes it more different from the many other high-level fire spells.


# Improve Energy Drain


With this component installed, the spell Energy Drain drains 1 level per 3 caster levels.


# Revise Comet and Dragon's Breath


Normally Comet and Dragon's Breath are basically the same spell, except Dragon's Breath is a bit better. This component makes the two spells more different. Comet now deals more damage than Dragon's Breath, but takes longer to cast and hits allies.


# Let Contingency and Chain Contingency be cast as a free action


Originally, Contingency spells could be cast instantly, even while the game was paused. This component restores that functionality.


# Let Farsight be cast as a free action


This component lets you also cast Farsight instantly even while the game is paused.


# Let Clairvoyance be cast indoors


This component lets you cast Clairvoyance to reveal the map indoors.


# Let Rangers and Paladins gain spells quicker and up to 6th-level spells


This component lets rangers and paladins gain spells at a reasonably fast rate. They get 1st-level spells starting at level 2. For every additional 3 levels, they gain a new spell level (2nd-level spells at level 5, 3rd-level spells at level 8... 6th-level spells at level 17). This way, they gain their highest-level spells at approximately the same time that mages get their highest-level spells.


# Let Rangers and Paladins cast spells at their full caster level


The makers of the Baldur's Gate games really were determined to make Paladin and Ranger spellcasting as crappy as possible. Not only do they get spell slots and new spell levels much slower than Clerics or Druids (which by itself is fine), they also cast spells at a much lower level than they should. Rangers cast spells as if 7 levels lower (so a spell that lasts 1 round/level only lasts 2 rounds if cast by a level 9 ranger), and Paladins cast spells as if 8 levels lower. This component fixes this unnecessary drawback, letting Rangers and Paladins cast spells at their full caster level.
