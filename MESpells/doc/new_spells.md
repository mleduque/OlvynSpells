Disruptive Surge
(Wild Magic)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

In using this spell, the Wild Mage deliberately employs wild magic to disrupt another creature's spell. The Wild Mage chooses a creature, which should be a spellcaster (arcane or divine). The next spell that creature casts within 5 rounds will trigger a wild surge. This surge will often cause the spell to fail, though it could have other, unpredictable effects.

Inertia
(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell drastically increases the inertia of the target, locking its movement in the direction it is currently moving. The effect of this spell depends on whether or not the target was moving when it was hit by the spell. If it was moving, it will continue hurtling nonstop in that direction against its will for 4 rounds. If it was standing in place, it will be immobilized for 4 rounds. A successful Saving Throw vs. Polymorph at -4 negates the effects of this spell.

Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This spell transports the caster to any point within the current area. When the spell is cast, a dimensional portal opens up in front of the caster, who immediately steps through it.

Dimension Door can be cast at a point too far away to see, as long as the party has seen it.

(Alteration)

Level: 1
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell allows a creature to jump higher and farther. Until the duration ends, the creature gains an ability they can use at will, which lets the creature jump up to 26 feet away.

While in the air, the creature is unaffected by certain ground-based spells like Entangle, Web, and Earthquake.

(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Range: 60 ft.
Duration: 6 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell curses the target to take more magical and elemental damage. The target must make a Save vs. Polymorph. On a failure, the target is cursed for 6 rounds. During that time, whenever the target would be dealt fire, cold, electricity, acid, or magic damage, it takes an additional 6 damage of that type. Hex is especially effective when combined with spells that deal damage multiple times, such as Magic Missile or Melf's Acid Arrow. Hex can also be cast by Invokers.

Taunt - Requires EEex
(Enchantment)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Taunt spell provokes an enemy into attacking the caster. If the target fails a Save vs. Breath, it is driven berserk and will attack the caster if possible rather than do any other action. If the target is a warrior (a fighter, ranger, paladin, or monk, including multiclassed warriors), it makes the save at a -6 penalty. Creatures immune to charm effects are immune to Taunt. The effects of Taunt end early if the caster dies.

Dimensional Chest
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 1
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: Special

During that round, if the wizard moves, the creature will be dragged along with &lt;HIMHER&gt;. There is no Saving Throw, though Magic Resistance can prevent the effects. The caster can cast Power Word, Pull on a creature even if &lt;HESHE&gt; cannot see the creature; however, the caster must be aware of the creature's existence and they must be on the same plane. Power Word, Pull is technically a summoning spell, as it summons the target of the spell.

Ghostwalk
(Alteration)

Level: 2
Range: 0
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell makes multiple allies partially ethereal for 1 round. While partially ethereal, creatures are immune to normal weapons and can move through walls.

Intoxicate
(Enchantment)

Level: 2
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Special
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

The target of this spell will instantly become dangerously drunk, far more than is pleasurable. The target gains four intoxication points for every Constitution point they have less than 25. For example, if the target has 10 Constitution, they will gain 60 intoxication points. Like normal drunkenness, this magical intoxication will wear off over time. A successful Save vs. Spell at -5 negates the effect. Intoxicate has no effect on undead or constructs. Multiple uses of this spell are cumulative.

Note: High levels of intoxication give luck penalties. The size of the penalty depends on the number of intoxication points:

0-49: No penalty
50-60: -2 Luck
60-69: -4 Luck
70-79: -6 Luck
80-89: -8 Luck
90-99: -10 Luck

While levitating, it is almost impossible for the target to hit or be hit by other creatures with melee weapons. The target is also unaffected by ground-based spells such as Grease, Entangle, Web and Earthquake. If the target is an ally, there is no Saving Throw necessary; otherwise, the target may make a Save vs. Polymorph at -3 to avoid the effects.

Bounce Spell

Duration: 2 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster

Duration: 1 turn/level
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: The caster

This simple but powerful spell should be cast when the wizard sees another spellcaster in the midst of casting a spell at &lt;HIMHER&gt;. It blocks the first spell (of any level) that hits the caster within the next 2 rounds. If a spell is blocked this way, the wizard absorbs its power, regaining a previously cast spell whose level is less than or equal to the level of the spell absorbed.

Level: 3
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This is the necromantic version of the second-level spell Horror. All creatures in the area of effect, friend or foe, must save vs. wands at -4 or run away in fear for 1 turn. Unlike the spell Horror, Terror actually physically harms targets' minds. Although this spell affects allies, this does not bother the necromancer, for &lt;HISHER&gt; allies are undead.

Legend Lore

Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

When this spell is cast, the caster stores a single 1st-level spell in the glyph, which is placed on a circular, 9-ft. radius area of the caster's choice. When a hostile creature passes within 9 feet of the glyph, it explodes, releasing a copy of the stored spell on each hostile creature within 12 feet.

Level: 3
Range: Familiar must be in the same area
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: The caster's familiar
Saving Throw: None

Familiar Spell imbues the caster's familiar with a spell. The caster chooses one of their 1st-level spells, consuming one use of that spell. For the next 8 hours, each time their familiar hits a creature with an attack, it instantly casts a copy of the chosen spell on the target. The spell is cast at the level of the familiar's owner, not at the level of the familiar. The familiar must be owned by the caster, and it must be in the same area as the caster when Familiar Spell is cast (and not in the caster's inventory).

Backstab Sequencer
(Illusion)

Level: 4
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Backstab Sequencer essentially lets the caster backstab a creature with a spell. The caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower.

Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

A Life Transfer allows the caster to exchange &lt;HISHER&gt; life force with that of another creature, even if that creature is unwilling.

Level: 5
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant

Range: 0
Duration: 1 round/level
Casting Time: 5

Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a magic circle that the party can use to teleport to another such circle. In casting this spell, the caster chooses one of seven sigil sequences for the teleportation circle. The circle is then created, and any other circle with the same sigil sequence is destroyed. The circle can be interacted with; by doing so the party can teleport to another circle with a different sigil sequence. Non-allied creatures cannot use these teleportation circles unless they are familiar with the sigil sequences.

There are certain areas that bar teleportation. Attempting to teleport into or out of these areas will fail.

Magical projectiles are also frozen immediately after being conjured. All creatures can still move and do actions while time is stopped.

In addition, arcane spellcasters in the area of effect forget three memorized spells each round due to the amnesia caused by Stygian ice. This spell has no effect on undead, constructs, or fiends. The caster is immune to &lt;HISHER&gt; own spell, but &lt;HISHER&gt; allies are not.

Death Trigger - Requires EEex
(Necromancy)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Permanent until death
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Death Trigger lets the caster store a single spell inside multiple allied creatures, to be released when they die. The caster must first choose a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. That spell is then stored inside each ally within 15 feet of the target, including summoned creatures. Each of these creatures will instantly cast their copy of the spell when they die. Note that the spell is treated as cast by the dying creature and at that creature's caster level (1 by default). If Death Trigger were to be cast again, the new spell would replace the previous spell stored in each target.

When selecting a spell, the caster can also choose whether the dying ally will release the spell on itself, on its previous attacker, or on the nearest enemy.

Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9

This spell "resurrects" the target as an undead creature under the caster's control. Reanimate cannot target a dead creature directly; it should be cast targeting the location of a corpse. The nearest dead creature to the target point, excluding undead, constructs, most extraplanar creatures, and creatures higher level than the caster, will be reanimated. The reanimated creature becomes undead, but can still use its abilities and spells. It is controlled by the caster until destroyed.

Extraordinary Luck
(Enchantment)

Level: 7
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 7 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 4 hours
Casting Time: 8

Saving Throw: None

An Enhance Attribute spell can vastly improve a single attribute of a creature. In casting this spell, the caster first chooses whether &lt;HESHE&gt; wishes to enhance a creature's Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma. Then &lt;HESHE&gt; points at a creature, or chooses &lt;HIMHER&gt;self. The spell sets the chosen attribute of the target creature to 24 for the duration, or until dispelled. The spell has no effect if the chosen attribute of the creature is already higher than 24.

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large, immobile sphere of illusionary magic. Any creature that enters the sphere becomes invisible. A creature can only become invisible via Globe of Invisibility once per round, even if there are multiple globes, though they become invisible regardless of when in the round they enter the area of effect. An effect that dispels illusionary protections will not dispel the globe, though it will dispel the invisibility that creatures obtained from the globe.

Otto's Irresistible Spin - Requires EEex
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Otto's Irresistible Spin forces multiple creatures to spin in place against their will for 1 turn. Affected creatures will do nothing other than repeatedly spin in place, even if they see enemies.

Recurring Contingency - Requires EEex, P
(All)

Level: 8
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster

Upon casting Recurring Contingency, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. During the next hour, the spell will be cast on the target each round that the condition is met (or each time the caster is hit, if the caster chose it to trigger upon getting hit).

Omnipresence - P
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

The spell Omnipresence spreads the essence of the target creature throughout the area, allowing the creature to do actions at longer range than normal. For the duration or until dispelled, the creature can attack any creature in sight with any weapon, even with melee weapons. The creature can also target other creatures with touch spells at long range, and can cast spells at a target outside their visual range. However, these effects also go the other way. An omnipresent creature can be attacked with melee weapons and targeted by touch spells at long range. Since Omnipresence makes the creature's form less solid, the creature can move through other creatures while under the effects of the spell.

Contingency Curse - Requires EEex, P
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature

Upon casting Contingency Curse, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 2nd-level or lower, choose a target for the spell, and choose conditions under which the spell will be released. The target of the spell is then cursed to cast that spell repeatedly under those conditions. For example, the caster could store a Web spell and make the creature cast Web on itself whenever it gets hit. Contingency Curse can only curse enemies.

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature

It lasts for 8 hours or until dispelled.

Sphere of Reversed Gravity - Requires EEex
(Alteration)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 turn
Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 18-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates a large spherical area that reverses the gravity of creatures inside it. Any creature that enters the area of effect will start falling up.

Casting Time: 8
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell bolsters a creature's life force through necromancy. For 8 hours, the target gains 10 temporary hit points per caster level.

Enslave
(Enchantment)

Level: 8
Range: Touch
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: Neg.

An especially potent mind-control spell, Enslave will make the target a permanent thrall of the caster. If the target fails its Save vs. Spell at -4, it is dominated by the caster until the effect is dispelled. The enslaved creature will not take any actions unless ordered by the caster, and it will not turn hostile if hurt by a party member. Undead and constructs are unaffected by Enslave.

Polar Ray
(Evocation)

Level: 8
Range: 30 ft.
Duration: 1 round
Casting Time: 5
Area of Effect: 2 ft. by 30 ft. jet
Saving Throw: None

Upon casting Polar Ray, the caster emits a powerful beam of frost at the target. The target and all creatures between the caster and the target take 12d6 cold damage. The polar ray deals the same damage again half a round later to the target and anyone who is still in the ray's path.

Clone Other
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 8
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 16 rounds
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

An offensive version of Simulacrum, Clone Other creates a simulacrum of another creature. The simulacrum is under the caster's control. The caster cannot clone &lt;HIMHER&gt;self, and the target's level must be less than or equal to the caster's. The simulacrum is at 60% of the target's level and has 60% of their Hit Points.

Metafireball - P
(Evocation)

Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

Also known as Fireballball, this spell launches a fireball that explodes into other fireballs. After the Metafireball explodes, each creature in the area of effect is hit by a separate fireball with its own area of effect.

Perfect Invisibility
(Illusion/Phantasm)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 2
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

This spell is the ultimate form of invisibility. While under the effect of Perfect Invisibility, a creature can attack, cast a spell or otherwise interact with another creature or object while remaining completely invisible. However, Perfect Invisibility can still be dispelled by effects that would dispel regular invisibility, such as True Sight or Dispel Magic. Barring such removal, the spell will last for 3 rounds. Perfect Invisibility can only be cast by Illusionists.

Mass Domination
(Enchantment/Charm)

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 12 rounds
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 25-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

The Mass Domination spell enables the caster to control the actions of a group of creatures while the spell is in effect. This control is maintained through a telepathic link between the caster and the victims. Unlike the 4th-level priest spell Mental Domination, the targets have no option for release, even if made to do something against their morals. This effect can only be reversed by Dispel Magic. The targets are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell with a -2 penalty to negate the effect.

Attain Perfection
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: 1 creature
Saving Throw: None

Vampiric Feast
(Necromancy)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 6 hours
Casting Time: 4
Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius
Saving Throw: None

Perhaps the most powerful life-draining spell, Vampiric Feast allows the caster to absorb Hit Points from many victims at once. Every creature in a 15-foot radius takes 30 damage with no Saving Throw. For every creature dealt damage this way, the caster gains 30 temporary hit points. Hit points gained this way are cumulative; the caster can gain a massive amount of health by draining many creatures with Vampiric Feast. The bonus hit points last for six hours.

Mass Sequencer - P
(Invocation)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: Permanent
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

Mass Sequencer allows the caster to cast one of &lt;HISHER&gt; spells on many creatures simultaneously. When Mass Sequencer is cast, the caster is prompted to store a single spell of 3rd-level or lower. Once activated, the sequencer will cast copies of the stored spell on every creature in a 15-foot radius around the target. For example, if the caster stores a Fireball spell and then activates the sequencer on a 15' radius area containing four creatures, then four fireballs will be launched, each targeting a different creature.

At higher levels, the maximum spell level that can be stored in a Mass Sequencer increases:

Caster Level Maximum Spell Level
18 and below 3
19-24 4
25-30 5
31-36 6
37-42 7
43-48 8
49 and above 9

Enoll Eva's Duplication - Requires EEex, P
(Alteration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 5 rounds
Casting Time: 6
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

This strange, fantastic spell hails from the Planes, where it was the byproduct of esoteric mathematical research by the modron mathemagician Enoll Eva. While Enoll Eva's Duplication is active, the caster's actions are multiplied by 2. The caster attacks twice as many times per round, and whenever &lt;HESHE&gt; casts a spell, &lt;HESHE&gt; immediately casts that spell an additional time, without using up a spell slot. Note that some spells do not stack and thus will not have double the effect when cast twice.

Area of Effect: 15-ft. radius

Level: 9
Range: Visual range of the caster

Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell creates an illusory adult red dragon, which will serve the caster for the duration. The illusory dragon has only 20% the hit points of a real dragon of the same age, and its attacks deal nonlethal damage, but its stats are otherwise the same as those of a real dragon, and it has the same abilities, including fire breath and an aura of fear.

Damage Turning
(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: 0
Duration: 3 rounds
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Damage Turning reflects damage from the caster back to the attacker. While Damage Turning is active, any damage that would be dealt to the caster from an attack, spell or ability is prevented. The source is dealt the full damage they would have dealt the caster. Other effects of attacks, spells, and abilities are not reflected; just the damage. Damage Turning can only be cast by Abjurers.

Protection From Time Stop - P
(Abjuration)

Level: 9
Range: Touch
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 7
Area of Effect: 1 creature

The recipient of this spell gains the ability to move and do actions while time is stopped.

(All)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster

All the spells restored must be 6th-level or lower. Eclectic Recall can restore 7th-level spells once the caster reaches level 24, and 8th-level spells once the caster reaches level 30.

Necropotence - P
(Necromancy)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Necropotence allows the wizard to draw the power for their spells through their own life force. For the duration, whenever the character would cast a spell, they immediately regain the cast spell but also take 3 damage per level of the spell. This damage cannot be prevented by any resistances, but it will not interrupt the spell.

Mental Agility - P
(Enchantment)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: 1 hour
Casting Time: 0
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None

Mental Agility drastically shortens the time necessary to cast spells. The wizard's casting time is reduced by 10 for the duration. Mental Agility cannot be combined with Improved Alacrity.

Freezing Wave
(Evocation)

Level: 10
Range: 0
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 15
Area of Effect: 60-ft. radius
Saving Throw: 1/2

Rampant Lightning
(Evocation)

Level: 10
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: Instant
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: 1/2

Rampant Lightning causes a great electrical explosion, releasing lightning bolts in all directions. Two lightning bolts are released per caster level, each one dealing 1d6 electricity damage (Save vs. Breath at -4 for half). It would be wise to make the entire party immune to electricity before casting this spell.

Culling Thought - Requires EEex
(Necromancy, Enchantment)

Level: 10
Range: Special
Duration: 8 hours
Casting Time: 3
Area of Effect: Special
Saving Throw: None

This spell enables the caster to slay weak creatures with a thought. For the duration, the caster gains the Culling Thought ability, which kills a creature with current HP less than the caster's level plus their Intelligence (so a 20th-level caster with 18 Intelligence could kill any creature with 38 HP or less). This ability can be used at will and as a free action, and can target any creature the party sees, even if the caster does not see it. If the target is not killed by Culling Thought, it remains unaware of the attempt and will not turn hostile.

Sphere of Annihilation - P
(Conjuration/Summoning)

Level: 10
Range: Visual range of the caster
Duration: 1 round/2 levels
Casting Time: 9
Area of Effect: 5-ft. radius
Saving Throw: Neg.

This spell creates a sphere of annihilation, which appears as a black ball with a 5 foot radius. The sphere of annihilation is a hole in the fabric of the multiverse. Any matter that touches it is utterly destroyed. If a creature crosses the sphere's path, the creature must make a Save vs. Breath to dodge the sphere; otherwise, the creature is disintegrated.

The sphere can be moved by the caster, but doing so requires enormous mental power. The higher the caster's Intelligence, the faster the sphere can be moved. The intense concentration used in controlling the sphere prevents the caster from casting any more spells while this spell is active.
